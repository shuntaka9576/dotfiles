## Git Commit

Create a git commit with an appropriate message based on:
1. Staged files and their changes
2. Past commit history patterns in this repository

When creating a commit:
- Analyze the staged changes using `git diff --cached`
- Review recent commit messages with `git log` to match the repository's style
- Generate a concise, descriptive commit message in English that follows the existing patterns
- Use `git commit -m "message"`
